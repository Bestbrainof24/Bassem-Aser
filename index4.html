    <p style="text-align:center;">Some Blockquoes that said about creativity and ambitious</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>1. “All profound distraction opens certain doors. You have to allow yourself to be distracted when you are unable to concentrate.”
           <footer>Julio Cortázar</footer> 
           <br><br>
           2. Cut down your workload. If you take on too many projects, start saying ‘no’. 
           
           If you have been trying to work on too many ideas, decide on a few that are important and put the rest on the backburner. 
           
           Sometimes if we are trying to spin too many plates, we aren’t leaving ourselves enough time for creativity to flow. 
           <br><br>
           3. Do nothing. Spend some time doing nothing. If you’re completely stuck on something, stop working on it for a little while. 
           
           The author Raymond Chandler had a stellar idea on how to deal with a creative block: Write or nothing. 
           
           Doing nothing is not the same as doing something else. Don’t give in to distractions: don’t read, write emails, browse Twitter or do your bookkeeping. 
           
           Be creative or do nothing. 
           <br><br>
           4. Stop. Sometimes the only answer is to say “Actually, this simply isn’t working at the moment.”  
           
           Don't be afraid to occasionally step away from projects. 
           
           Create some distance. Take a big break. 
           
           Come back to it with a clear head when you are ready.
           <br><br>
           5. “Most artists have experienced the creative block. We get stuck in our work. We beat our head against the wall: nothing. Sometimes, it is because we are trying something at the wrong time.”
           <footer>Lukas Foss</footer>
           <br><br>
           Assess the problem
           6. “I think creative blocks come from people’s life journeys. If you don’t know who you are or what you’re about or what you believe in, it’s really pretty impossible to be creative.” 
          <footer> Rainn Wilson</footer>
           <br><br>
           7. Do a personal assessment and not just the creative part. 
           
           Sometimes creative blocks are caused by other issues or blockages in our lives. 
           
           Don’t just treat the symptom; address the root problem,Assess the problem.</p>
